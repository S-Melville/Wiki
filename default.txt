Hearthstone is a strategy card game developed by Blizzard entertainment.

The basic rules of the game are very similar to that of "top trumps" - a popular card game in the 80s. In Hearthstone, two opponents create constructed decks of thirty cards along with a class hero each with its own unique power. Players use mana crystals to cast spells or summon minions to attack the opponent, with the goal to reduce the opponent's health to zero. 

Winning matches earns the player gold, an in game currency which can be used to purchase rewards such as new cards and heroes. Like many other "free to play" games, Hearthstone has many in app purchases which allows the player to use real world currency to purchase additional content. 

The game features several modes of play: 

Casual/Ranked matches - the player has access to unlocked cards and constructs a deck comprising of 30 cards.
Arena matches - the player has to construct a new deck picking 1 of 3 cards the game offers until a full deck is made.
Challenge mode - Challenge somebody in your friends list.
Tavern Brawl - Unique game mode where the rules change every week. 

To keep the game fresh, new content is regularly added. This includes new card sets in addition to single-player adventures that reward the player with collectible cards upon completion.
